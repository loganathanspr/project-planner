# Epic: [Short, action-oriented name]

**Goal:** What is the purpose of this epic? (1–2 sentences)  
**Why:** Why this matters (user value, learning, or system impact)  
**Boundaries (Out of Scope):** What’s explicitly _not included_  
**Deliverables:** Tangible outcomes (e.g., MVPs, docs, demos)  
**Definition of Done (DoD):** What must exist to mark this epic complete  
**Dependencies:** Other epics or external inputs  
**Labels:** epic, [domain], [team/area]

---

### Notes:

- Keep scope limited to one clear goal.
- Avoid mixing domains or unrelated tasks.
- Split large epics (>4 weeks) into smaller ones.
- Once MVPs are defined, freeze this epic’s scope.
